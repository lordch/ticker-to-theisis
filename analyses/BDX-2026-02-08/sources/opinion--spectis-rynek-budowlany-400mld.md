# Wartosc rynku budowlanego w Polsce do 2026 r. przekroczy 400 mld zl - Spectis

## Market Size Figures

**Historical Data:**
- 2016: 177 billion PLN
- 2024: Over 350 billion PLN
- Growth: Market value "doubled over the last eight years"

**Forecasts:**
- 2026: "will exceed 400 billion PLN for the first time in history"
- Market ratio to GDP: Expected to return to over 10% by 2026 (down from 12% peak in 2011)

## Growth Assessment

The report indicates "nominal growth mainly resulting from rising material and labor costs" rather than real volume increases. Construction consumption of basic materials has remained flat for over a decade.

## EU Funding Sources

- Recovery and Resilience Facility (KPO): 58 billion euros (grants and loans)

## Key Growth Drivers

Primary stimulants include:
- EU infrastructure funding and KPO investment programs
- National Road and Rail programs continuation
- Energy transition initiatives
- Housing shortage relative to EU averages
- Military construction expansion
- Planned megaprojects: nuclear power plants, offshore wind farms, Central Communication Hub, high-speed rail

## Risk Factors

Negative pressures comprise demographic challenges, excessive deficit procedures, elevated interest rates, high material costs, geopolitical uncertainty, and labor shortages in construction.
