2. **Administrative delays**: Environmental permits averaging >1 year; appeals (KIO) reached 5,900 by Nov 2025 vs. 3,500 in 2022
3. **Investment concentration**: Multiple projects launching simultaneously risk labor, material, equipment shortages

## Long-Term Market Scale
- Previously estimated: ~1 trillion PLN
- Updated projection (defense, offshore, construction, energy): ~1.5 trillion PLN through 2040

## Investment Thesis
Management positions Budimex as a "competency conglomerate" shifting beyond pure contractor toward infrastructure-energy group with diversified streams (defense, atomic, ports, renewables, data). Success hinges on materializing new segments (particularly OZE and data centers) while defending margins amid price wars and administrative bottlenecks. Dividend policy: 100% of earnings recommended for 2025-2030.
