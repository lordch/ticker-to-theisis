## Company Positioning
Budimex holds the highest security clearance levels, including "NATO Secret" and "Secret EU" certifications, enabling participation in strategic defense contracts previously restricted.

## Strategic Context
Poland allocated over 4% of GDP to defense-related objectives. In March 2025, approximately 30 billion PLN was redirected from the National Recovery Plan to the Security and Defense Fund, creating expanded opportunities for infrastructure contractors.

## Key Statement
President Artur Popko emphasized that "military infrastructure construction represents strategic development direction" while maintaining "highest safety standards" through NATO and EU institutional partnerships.
