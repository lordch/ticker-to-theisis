# Budimex celuje w kontrakty za ponad 8 mld zl w 2025 - StockWatch

## Primary Targets
- **Contracting goal 2025**: Over 8 billion PLN (minimum 8.5 billion PLN target)
- **Backlog target end-2025**: Exceeding 18 billion PLN
- **Current backlog (Q3 2025)**: 16.2 billion PLN

## 2025 Performance to Date
- Contracts signed through Q3 2025: 3.9 billion PLN (vs. 8.2 billion PLN in same 2024 period)
- Pipeline in "waiting room": 5.1 billion PLN, including 2.5 billion PLN in rail segment

## CEO Commentary - Artur Popko (President)

"After three quarters we have 5.1 billion PLN in contracts pending, up 2 billion PLN quarter-on-quarter, including 2.5 billion PLN in the rail segment."

"Remember 2024 was incomparable due to unprecedented tender concentration. Average contracting 2020-2023 was ~8 billion PLN, similar results expected this year, our target is minimum 8.5 billion PLN signed."

"We want to continue increasing backlog in 2026, but not everything depends on us. We still face numerous questions extending tender processes and appeals delaying contract signing."

## Strategic Outlook
- Expected revenue acceleration in 2026 as "design-build" contracts enter execution phase
- 220+ active projects across Poland, Germany, Czech Republic, Slovakia, Latvia, and Estonia
- Historical revenue growth: 6-7% annually; target acceleration through 2030
- Committed to maintaining profitability levels
