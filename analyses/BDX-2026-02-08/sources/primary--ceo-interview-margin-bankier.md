# Budimex chce utrzymac marze operacyjna - CEO Interview (Bankier.pl)

## Financial Targets & Performance

**Operating Margin Goal:** Budimex aims to maintain approximately 8% operating margin in both short and long term. In 2024, the company achieved 8.2% (up from 8% in 2023).

**Order Backlog:** CEO Artur Popko stated the company enters 2025 with a "historic" order portfolio of nearly 18 billion PLN, with approximately two-thirds signed in the previous year.

## CEO Quotes (Artur Popko)

**On margin stability:** "We can expect an operating profitability level of around 8 percent. Margin improvement is the result of ongoing diversification, responsible cost control and price stabilization."

**On contract structure:** "A significant portion of our portfolio consists of long-term contracts, allowing us to plan operations over a longer horizon, which is not standard in construction."

**On pricing strategy:** "Our order portfolio level allows us to approach tenders responsibly. We don't need to engage in aggressive price wars we observe on market."

**On geographic expansion:** "Our long-term goal is achieving the position of the largest construction company in Central-Eastern Europe."

## Strategic Priorities

- Geographic diversification (Czech Republic focus)
- Long-term contracts (majority 2-year execution periods)
- Renewable energy investments and PPP projects
- Rail infrastructure development (Rail Baltica, Estonia projects)

## Key Challenges

Polish market financing stability for infrastructure, particularly railway sector funding mechanisms.
