# Budimex zaklada stabilny wzrost przychodow; nacisk na energetyke - CEO Interview (Bankier.pl)

## Growth Strategy & Energy Focus

**CEO Artur Popko stated:** "We want to develop sustainably and responsibly. We're preparing an action strategy enabling stable growth. Energy -- primarily transmission networks and nuclear -- is a key investment area."

The company is expanding into transmission networks, a new segment for Budimex. Poland's energy infrastructure plans through 2034 allocate over 64 billion zloty for transmission network development, representing significant opportunity.

## Market Position & Targets

Budimex aims for **15% market share** in transmission networks, matching its position in rail and road segments. If successful in contract acquisition, energy projects could substantially contribute to revenue structure within a decade.

## Revenue Expectations

The company targets approximately **1 billion zloty annually from international operations**, primarily from the Rail Baltica contract in Latvia. This stabilizes total revenue levels while the Polish market remains the strategic priority.

## Domestic Market Assessment

Popko indicated 2025 appears more favorable than 2024 for Polish construction. He expects modest growth in construction-assembly production, supported by interest rate reductions improving residential market conditions. However, he notes fierce competition remains intense, with contractor capacity exceeding available tender opportunities.

## International Expansion

Beyond Ukraine considerations, Budimex emphasizes Poland's importance. The company recently won first place in Estonia's Rail Baltica tender (332 million euros), holding 40% of construction contracts.
