## Executive Summary

**Thesis: HOLD with positive bias — quality compounder entering a supercycle, but priced for it.**

Budimex is Poland's dominant construction company (9.1B PLN Group revenue, #1 by 36% margin over #2 Strabag) with an extraordinary financial profile: ~8% EBIT margins in an industry where European peers earn <5%, ROE consistently >45%, net cash of 1.9B PLN, and 100% dividend payout through 2030. The company is positioned at the epicenter of a once-in-a-generation EU-funded infrastructure supercycle, with ~61.5B PLN in government tenders planned for 2026 alone (GDDKiA + CPK + PKP PLK).

However, the stock trades at 698 PLN — above the average analyst target of ~617 PLN — suggesting the market has already priced in significant growth. Competitive intensity is rising sharply (13-17 bidders per tender vs 6-7 historically), and the CEO missed his own 2025 backlog target by 10%. The energy diversification strategy, while strategically sound, is aspirational (134M PLN in energy vs 9B total revenue = 1.5%).

**Key metrics:**

| Metric | Value | Assessment |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Revenue (2024, Group) | 9.0 bln PLN | Flat vs 2023 peak (9.8B) |
| EBIT margin (9M'25, construction) | 8.1% | At structural high; 2x European peers |
| ROE (2023) | ~53% | Extraordinary; driven by thin equity base |
| Net cash | 1.9 bln PLN (Sep'25) | Declining from 3.9B (Dec'23) due to capex + dividends |
| Backlog | 16.2 bln PLN (Dec'25) | ~2x annual revenue; below 18B target |
| Dividend yield | ~3.6% (2024 DPS 25.43 PLN) | 100% payout policy through 2030 |
| P/E (trailing, 2024 NI 613M) | ~29x | Premium to European construction peers (12-18x) |

## 1. Company Overview

### What Budimex Does

Budimex S.A. is Poland's largest construction group, listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (GPW) since 1995. The company operates through two reporting segments:

**Construction segment** (~90% of Group revenue):
- Infrastructure/roads: 40% of construction revenue (GDDKiA expressways, bypasses)
- Rail: 26% (PKP PLK modernizations, new lines)
- General building: 32% (commercial, industrial, residential — residential being wound down)
- Includes subsidiaries: Mostostal Kraków (steel structures, 805M PLN revenue in 2024), Budimex Kolejnictwo (rail equipment)

**Services segment** (~10% of Group revenue):
- FBSerwis (facility management, road maintenance, waste management): 937M PLN revenue, 10.0% EBIT margin (2024)
- Higher-margin, more recurring than construction

### Corporate Structure

## 2. The Bull Case: Infrastructure Supercycle

### 2.1. The Pipeline Is Real and Massive

Three primary government sources document a **combined ~61.5 bln PLN** in planned 2026 tenders:

| Agency | 2026 Tender Plan | Key Projects |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|
| **GDDKiA** (roads) | ~12 bln PLN | S11 expressway (108 km), S19 (Białystok), 10 bypasses |
| **CPK** (megaproject) | ~40 bln PLN | Warsaw-Łódź high-speed rail (>10B framework), airport roads (2.2B), terminal |
| **PKP PLK** (rail) | ~9.5 bln PLN | Modlin-Warsaw connection, Wrocław metro rail, 16 major projects |

Even at **50% realization rate**, this represents >30B PLN in actual tender volume — 3-4x recent annual contract signing rates.

Beyond 2026, the government has committed to ~**1 trillion PLN** in infrastructure programs through 2040:
- National Road Construction Program: 294B PLN (to 2033)
- Nuclear power plants: ~200B PLN
- CPK: >130B PLN
- National Railway Program: 100B PLN
- Offshore wind: >100B PLN
- PSE transmission grid: 62B PLN

### 2.2. EU Funding at Record Levels

Poland is the largest beneficiary of EU infrastructure funding in the current cycle:

| Program | Allocation | Construction-relevant share |
|---------|-----------|---------------------------|
| **FENIKS** (2021-2027) | 24.2 bln EUR | Infrastructure 9.2B, rail 10.2B |
| **KPO** (National Recovery Plan) | ~60 bln EUR | Green mobility 15.4B, energy 6.5B |
| **CEF** (Connecting Europe Facility) | 32.3 bln EUR | Infrastructure + rail 24.7B |

Total EU-linked funding: **~130 bln EUR** over 2021-2027 (n+3 disbursement extends to 2030).

**Caveat:** 7 bln EUR from KPO has been reallocated to military spending (March 2025). This reduces infrastructure allocation but adds a defense construction opportunity.

### 2.3. Budimex Is Best-Positioned to Capture Share

- **#1 by revenue** (9.1B PLN vs Strabag's 6.7B — 36% gap)
- **#1 by profitability** (1.2B PLN operating profit — highest in sector, per Deloitte)
- **~48% of GDDKiA road contracts** in 2024 (Strefa Inwestorów data)
- **~15-20% of PKP PLK rail contracts** on average
- **NATO Secret + Secret EU clearances** for defense construction
- **CPK preference clause** favoring Polish language proficiency and local experience
- **50+ years of track record** and reference projects for prequalification

---

## 3. The Bear Case: Priced for Perfection

### 3.1. Competitive Intensity Is Rising Sharply

The number of bidders per tender has increased from **6-7 historically to 13-17+** (CEO commentary, Strefa Inwestorów data). This fundamentally changes pricing dynamics:

- In roads (2025): Mirbud #1 (7 contracts, 1.5B PLN), **Budimex #2** (5 contracts, 1.4B PLN)
- In rail (2025): PORR #1 (2.2B PLN), Torpol #2 (2.0B PLN), **Budimex #3** (1.8B PLN)
- In energy (2025): Enprom #1 (461M PLN), **Budimex** tiny (134M PLN)

**Budimex is NOT #1 in every segment** despite the overall revenue lead. The "dominant everywhere" narrative is challenged.

### 3.2. Backlog Target Miss

CEO Popko targeted >18B PLN backlog at end-2025. Actual: **16.2B PLN** — a 10% miss. Contributing factors:
- 9M'25 contracting of only 3.9B PLN vs 8.2B in 9M'24 (**-52%**)
- KIO appeals surged from 3,500 (2022) to **5,900** (Nov 2025) — administrative bottleneck
- CEO: "We still face numerous questions extending tender processes and appeals delaying contract signing"

The pipeline "waiting room" of 10.2B PLN (5.1B domestic + 5.1B international) with 90-95% conversion rate provides a buffer, but the miss signals that the supercycle is not yet flowing smoothly into Budimex's order book.

### 3.3. Margin Compression Risk

The current 8.1% EBIT margin in construction represents a **structural high** — up from 4% in 2019-2020. But:

- Sector-wide margin compression is underway: large firms' margins fell from 11.4% (2023) to 7.7% (9M'25)
- SII notes "normalization of margins after strong 2021-2023 period"
- Current margins reflect contracts signed in a less competitive 2022-2024 environment
- As those contracts roll off and new ones priced with 13-17 bidders replace them, margins face headwinds

Q4 2025's **12.8% EBIT margin** (a 9-year high) was driven by reserve releases on completing contracts — a one-time effect, not a sustainable run-rate.

### 3.4. Labor Shortage

Credit Agricole estimates a **53,000 worker shortfall** in Polish construction by 2026. Budimex employs 7,742 directly but relies on 12,000 subcontractor firms. Ukrainian migration policy changes (visa restrictions, mobilization) are a structural risk. Construction labor costs rose **+7.1% YoY** in 2025.

### 3.5. Valuation Is Full

| Metric | BDX (current) | European peers |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| P/E (trailing) | ~29x | 12-18x |
| Dividend yield | ~3.6% | 3-5% |
| Price vs avg analyst target | **+13% above** (698 vs 617) | — |
| Analyst consensus | 6 Buy, 2 Hold, 2 Reduce | — |
| Target range | 420-750 PLN | — |

Noble Securities has a Reduce at 590 PLN (-15% downside). The stock trading above average target suggests the market is pricing in catalysts that consensus hasn't fully modeled.

## 4. Financial Analysis

### 4.1. Income Statement Trajectory

**Group Consolidated (mln PLN):**

| | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 | 9M'25 |
|---|------|------|------|------|------|-------|
| Revenue | 7,911 | 9,802 | 8,619 | 9,802 | 9,016 | 6,409 |
| Gross Profit | — | — | 872 | 1,125 | — | — |
| EBIT | — | — | 562 | 781 | 750* | 509 |
| Net Profit | 986** | 548 | 548 | 746 | 613 | 441 |
| EBIT margin | ~7.4% | ~7.6% | 6.5% | 8.0% | 8.3%* | 7.9% |

*Parent-level EBIT data. **Includes one-off from Budimex Nieruchomości sale.

**Key observations:**
- Revenue has been range-bound at 8-10B PLN for 5 years. Growth is coming from margins, not top line.
- EBIT margin doubled from ~4% (2019) to 8%+ — the key value creation story.
- Net profit normalized at ~600-750M PLN. The 100% payout makes this directly translatable to dividends.

### 4.2. Segment Profitability

**Construction segment (9M'25):**
- Revenue: 5,852 mln PLN
- EBIT: 476 mln PLN
- **EBIT margin: 8.1%** (up from 7.6% in 9M'24, 7.2% in 9M'23)

**Services segment / FBSerwis (9M'25):**
- Revenue: 670 mln PLN
- EBIT: 63 mln PLN
- **EBIT margin: 9.4%** (up from 9.0% in 9M'24)

FBSerwis standalone: EBIT margin **10.7%** in 9M'25 — the highest-quality earnings in the group. Road maintenance, waste management, and facility services provide recurring, higher-margin income. FBSerwis EBITDA margin of 16.5% is more typical of a services business than construction.

**Mostostal Kraków (9M'25):**
- Revenue: 463 mln PLN
- EBIT: 38.4 mln PLN (8.3% margin)
- Contraction +82% r/r — strong momentum in steel structures

### 4.3. Balance Sheet & Capital Structure

**As of Dec 2023 (most recent annual data from annual report):**

| Item | Value (mln PLN) |
|------|----------------|
| Cash & equivalents | **3,900** |
| Total assets | ~9,500 |
| Equity (Group) | **1,561** |
| Short-term liabilities | 5,732 |
| Long-term liabilities | 865 |
| Equity/assets ratio | **16.4%** |

**As of Sep 2025 (from investor presentation):**
- Net cash: **1,900 mln PLN** (down from 3,900 at end-2023 due to dividends and capex)

**Credit facilities (Dec 2023):**

| Bank | Type | Amount (mln PLN) |
|------|------|-----------------|
| Credit Agricole | Working capital | 70 |
| ING Bank Śląski | Overdraft | 60 |
| Santander | Overdraft | 150 |
| Bank PEKAO | Guarantee/deposits | 150 |
| Société Générale | Guarantee/deposits | 70 |
| **Total** | | **500** |

**The Negative Working Capital Model:**

Budimex's balance sheet is characteristic of public-sector construction: short-term liabilities (5.7B PLN — primarily advance payments from government clients and trade payables to subcontractors) massively exceed the equity base (1.6B). This is NOT financial distress — it is the business model. Government clients pay advances that fund operations, allowing Budimex to generate returns without deploying its own capital.

Liquidity ratios:
- Current ratio: 1.12 (adequate)
- Quick ratio: 0.97 (tight but typical for construction)
- Debt coverage ratio: 0.82 (liabilities/assets — high but almost entirely non-interest-bearing)

**No material bank debt.** Only working capital lines of 500M PLN vs 3.9B cash.

**Gap: Off-balance-sheet guarantees** (bank/insurance guarantees for contract performance) are not quantified in available sources. Industry norm is 10-30% of backlog, implying **1.6-4.9B PLN** in contingent obligations. These are a risk if contracts fail but are standard and typically covered by insurance.

### 4.4. Returns on Capital

| Year | Net Profit (M) | Avg Equity (M) | ROE |
|------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| 2021 | 548 | ~950 | **~58%** |
| 2022 | 548 | ~1,090 | **~50%** |
| 2023 | 746 | ~1,415 | **~53%** |
| 2024 | 613 | ~1,250 | **~49%** |

**ROE of 45-58% is extraordinary** — 3-4x European construction peers:
- Strabag ROE: ~15-20%
- Skanska ROE: ~20-25%
- Vinci ROE: ~15-20%
- European sector average: ~10-15%

**Why ROIC is meaningless here:** Traditional ROIC (NOPAT / Invested Capital) produces infinite or negative values because Budimex has negative invested capital — cash exceeds equity + debt. The company generates profit without deploying investor capital. This is the single most distinctive financial characteristic: **Budimex is a capital-free business model** funded by government prepayments.

### 4.5. Free Cash Flow & Dividend Sustainability

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| FCF (TTM, Sep 2025) | 403 mln PLN |
| Net profit (2024) | 613 mln PLN |
| **FCF / Net Profit** | **~66%** |
| Dividend paid (2025) | 649 mln PLN |
| **Dividend / FCF** | **~161%** |

**The FCF problem:** Dividends exceed FCF by a significant margin. The gap is funded by:
1. The negative working capital model (customer prepayments generate operating cash above net profit in most years)
2. Drawdown of accumulated cash (declined from 3.9B to 1.9B over 2 years)

**FCF is declining** (-25% 5Y CAGR per AlphaSpread) due to rising CAPEX:
- 2023: 142 mln PLN total CAPEX
- 9M'25: **228 mln PLN** (annualizing to ~300M+)
- Investment areas: rail equipment (58M), OZE renewables (28M), roads (54M), services (40M)

This creates a tension: the 100% payout policy is mathematically inconsistent with the capex ramp. Either:
- (a) Capex normalizes after fleet build-out, restoring FCF → sustainable
- (b) Working capital swings from new mega-contracts provide the cash → cyclically sustainable
- (c) Cash reserves eventually deplete → unsustainable without policy change

**Assessment:** Path (b) is most likely. The 2026-2028 supercycle should generate massive working capital inflows from government prepayments on new contracts. Dividend sustainability is tied to the cycle.

### 4.6. Dividend Analysis

| Year | DPS (PLN) | Payout ratio | Yield (at 698) |
|------|----------|-------------|----------------|
| 2020 | 16.70 | ~100% | 2.4% |
| 2021 | 38.37* | >100% | 5.5% |
| 2022 | 17.99 | ~100% | 2.6% |
| 2023 | 35.69 | ~100% | 5.1% |
| 2024 | 25.43 | ~100% | 3.6% |

*Includes interim dividend from Budimex Nieruchomości sale.

**17 consecutive years of dividend payments.** Formal 100% payout policy adopted for 2022-2030.

At normalized earnings of 650-750M PLN and 25.53M shares, DPS ranges 25-29 PLN, implying **3.6-4.2% yield** at current prices. If the supercycle drives earnings to the projected 2027E level (~750-850M PLN), DPS could reach 29-33 PLN (4.2-4.7% yield).

---

## 5. Competitive Position & Moat Assessment

### Arguments FOR a Moat

1. **Scale and self-funding model:** Budimex is the only Polish builder large enough to self-finance mega-contracts through the negative working capital cycle. Government prepayments fund operations; competitors need bank financing. This is a structural advantage in a rising-rate environment.

2. **Reference experience / prequalification:** For contracts >500M PLN, prequalification requirements (completed projects of similar scale, financial standing, equipment) eliminate most competitors. Budimex's 50+ year track record and 220+ active projects provide unmatched reference credentials.

3. **NATO/EU security clearances:** Only a handful of contractors hold NATO Secret and Secret EU classifications required for defense infrastructure. With 10B PLN/year in defense spending and the Tarcza Wschód (Eastern Shield) program, this is a hard barrier.

4. **FBSerwis as recurring revenue:** The services arm (937M PLN, 10% EBIT margin) provides a higher-quality, more predictable earnings stream that pure contractors lack.

5. **Pricing discipline enabled by backlog depth:** CEO: "Our order portfolio level allows us to approach tenders responsibly. We don't need to engage in aggressive price wars." A 16B backlog covering 2 years of revenue gives Budimex the luxury of selectivity.

### Arguments AGAINST a Moat

1. **Market fragmentation:** 3.9% market share in a market where the top 5 hold only 11.3%. No single player dominates — construction is structurally fragmented.

2. **Rising competition:** 13-17 bidders per tender (vs 6-7 historically) for standard GDDKiA contracts. Foreign players (Strabag +16.7% growth, PORR winning CPK and PKP PLK) are gaining share.

3. **Commodity-like service:** Construction is fundamentally a low-differentiation business. The product (building a road or railway) is defined by the client's specifications. Pricing power is limited.

4. **No intellectual property:** Unlike tech or pharma, construction moats are entirely about execution, relationships, and scale — all of which can be replicated over time.

### Moat Verdict

**Narrow moat, cyclically dependent.** Budimex has real advantages (scale, references, clearances, working capital) that provide a 2-3 year competitive buffer. But these advantages erode if the cycle turns — in a downturn, even large builders engage in price wars. The moat is widest during boom periods (when prequalification gates limit competition on mega-contracts) and narrowest during bust periods (when everyone chases shrinking order pools).

## 6. Growth Catalysts & Risks

### Near-Term Catalysts (2026-2027)

| Catalyst | Probability | Impact | Timing |
|----------|------------|--------|--------|
| CPK tender acceleration (40B PLN in 2026) | Medium-High | Very High | Q2-Q4 2026 |
| GDDKiA 2026 tenders (12B PLN, 212+ km) | High | High | Throughout 2026 |

## 7. Valuation Framework

### What You're Paying For

At 698 PLN / ~17.8B PLN market cap:

| Approach | Calculation | Implied Value |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| P/E on 2024 NI (613M) | 29x | Current price |
| P/E on normalized NI (700M) | 25x | Fair if no growth |
| P/E on 2027E NI (~850M) | 21x | Reasonable for growth |
| Dividend yield on 2024 DPS (25.4) | 3.6% | Below 5-year avg (~5%) |
| EV/EBIT on 2024 EBIT (750M) | ~21x | Premium to sector |

**The market is pricing ~15-20% earnings growth over 2-3 years**, which aligns with consensus projections (9.4B revenue in 2025E → 10.7B in 2026E → 12.5B in 2027E, per PPCG).

### Peer Comparison

| Company | Market | P/E | EBIT margin | ROE | Div yield |
|---------|--------|-----|-------------|-----|-----------|
| **Budimex** | Poland | ~29x | 8.1% | ~50% | 3.6% |
| Strabag | Europe | ~12x | ~3-4% | ~15% | ~4% |
| Skanska | Sweden | ~16x | ~4-5% | ~20% | ~3% |
| Vinci | France | ~14x | ~6-7% | ~15% | ~4% |
| PORR | Austria | ~10x | ~3-4% | ~15% | ~3% |

Budimex trades at a **significant premium** to European peers. This premium reflects:
- Higher margins (2x peers)
- Higher returns (3-4x peers)
- Exposure to Poland's supercycle (faster-growing market)
- 100% payout policy

**Is the premium justified?** Partially. The quality gap (margins, ROIC) is real and sustainable. But a 29x P/E on cyclical construction earnings leaves no margin of safety if margins revert to 6-7% (which would cut earnings by ~15-20%).

### Price Targets

| Scenario | 2027E EPS | Multiple | Price | Return |
|----------|----------|----------|-------|--------|
| **Bull** (margins sustain 8%+, revenue 12.5B) | ~33 PLN | 25x | **825 PLN** | +18% |
| **Base** (margins compress to 7%, revenue 11B) | ~27 PLN | 22x | **594 PLN** | -15% |
| **Bear** (cycle stalls, margins 6%, revenue 9B) | ~20 PLN | 18x | **360 PLN** | -48% |

The skew is negative at current prices: +18% upside vs -15 to -48% downside. This reflects the valuation premium already embedded.

## 8. What Would Change the View

### To BUY (increase conviction):
- Stock corrects to 550-600 PLN range (15-20% pullback) → attractive entry
- Q1 2026 contract signing acceleration (>3B PLN in single quarter) → supercycle confirmation
- Energy segment wins a >500M PLN contract → diversification de-risking
- Ferrovial announces formal commitment to holding Budimex → removes overhang
- CPK breaks ground on first construction package → removes execution risk

### To SELL:
- EBIT margin falls below 7% for two consecutive quarters → margin thesis broken
- Backlog drops below 14B PLN → demand weakness
- Government delays/cancels CPK or road programs → thesis driver removed
- Ferrovial announces accelerated divestment → technical pressure
- Dividend cut or policy change before 2030 → income thesis broken

## 9. Key Data Points to Monitor

| Metric | Frequency | Where to Find | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
| Construction EBIT margin | Quarterly | Investor presentations | Alert if <7% |
| Backlog value | Quarterly | IR reports | Alert if <14B PLN |
| New contract signing | Quarterly | Current reports | Compare to 8.5B annual target |
| GDDKiA/PKP PLK tender execution | Monthly | gov.pl, plk-sa.pl | vs announced plans |
| KIO appeals trend | Semi-annual | UZP statistics | Acceleration = negative |
| Net cash position | Quarterly | Balance sheet | Alert if <1B PLN |
| Sector margin trends | Semi-annual | GUS, Deloitte report | Large firms <6% = warning |
| Ferrovial stake transactions | Continuous | BiznesRadar, KNF filings | Any change from 50.1% |
| CPK tender awards | Event-driven | cpk.pl | BDX win/loss on first packages |

## 10. Conclusion

Budimex is an exceptional company in a structurally advantaged position. The combination of market leadership, extraordinary returns on capital, a self-funding business model, and exposure to the largest infrastructure investment cycle in Polish history creates a compelling long-term investment case.

**But exceptional companies can be poor investments at the wrong price.** At 698 PLN and ~29x trailing earnings, Budimex is priced for a flawless execution of the supercycle thesis. The risks — margin compression from rising competition, administrative bottlenecks, CPK execution uncertainty, and labor shortages — are not adequately discounted.

**Recommendation: HOLD with positive bias.**

- For current holders: Hold. The quality of the business and the secular tailwinds justify continued ownership. The 3.6% dividend yield provides income while waiting.
- For prospective buyers: Wait for a better entry point. A 15-20% correction to the 550-600 PLN range would offer a more favorable risk-reward.
- For the supercycle believer: The thesis requires CPK + GDDKiA + PKP PLK to execute their 2026 tender plans at >50% realization. If this happens, 2027 earnings could justify 750-825 PLN. But you're paying 698 today for that possibility.

**The best investments are great companies at fair prices. Budimex is a great company at a full price.**
