# Writing Craft Engine

> Transform prose. Preserve logic. Output clean.

---

## Rules

1. **Preserve all analytical content** — methodology, evidence, scenarios, sources
2. Active over passive
3. Short word over long
4. Concrete over abstract
5. Positive over negative
6. Break rules to avoid awkward writing

**Test:** Would a senior PM find all the reasoning they need?

---

## Content Preservation (CRITICAL)

**MUST PRESERVE:**
- Sensitivity tables and valuation matrices
- All analytical tensions/debates with full arguments
- Probability-weighted scenarios with explicit percentages
- Kill conditions and monitoring frameworks
- Sources table with citations
- Position sizing rationale
- DCF/valuation methodology (not just conclusions)

**MAY TIGHTEN:**
- Filler phrases and qualifiers
- Redundant transitions
- Verbose sentence constructions

**NEVER CUT:**
- Entire sections or debates
- Evidence supporting conclusions
- Numerical analysis or tables

---

## Sentences

**Vary length.** Long explains. Short punches.

> "Management divested non-core assets while accelerating investment in high-margin recurring revenue."
> "The market missed it."

**Mix:** 60% medium (15-25 words), 25% short, 15% long.

**80%+ active voice:**

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "It was determined costs should be reduced" | "Management cut costs" |
| "Revenue growth is expected" | "We expect revenue growth" |

**Verbs over -tion/-ment nouns:**

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "Implementation of the strategy" | "Implement the strategy" |
| "Made an examination of" | "Examined" |
| "Achievement of profitability" | "Became profitable" |

**Kill:** actually, really, basically, very, somewhat, essentially, relatively.

**Flip negatives:**

| Don't | Do |
|-------|-----|
| "Not unlikely" | "Likely" |
| "Does not have" | "Lacks" |

---

## Paragraphs

- One idea each
- Topic sentence first (80%)
- 3-5 sentences max
- Single-sentence paragraphs punch (use 2-4 per doc)

**Transitions:** However, Moreover, Therefore, Critically.

## Words

| Long | Short |
|------|-------|
| Utilize | Use |
| Implement | Do |
| Facilitate | Help |
| Subsequently | Then |
| Ascertain | Find out |

| Bloat | Tight |
|-------|-------|
| Due to the fact that | Because |
| In the event that | If |
| At this point in time | Now |
| Has the ability to | Can |
| In order to | To |
| With regard to | About |

**Hedge only uncertainty.** Don't hedge beliefs:

| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "Could potentially be attractive" | "Attractive" |
| "Seems like it might be undervalued" | "Undervalued" |

---

## Structure

**Tables:** 3+ item comparisons, time series, scenarios.

**Bullets:** 3+ parallel items. Complete sentences.

**White space:** Break every 3-5 paragraphs.

---

## Opening & Closing

**Cut throat-clearing.** Delete "In this memo we examine..." Start with your point.

| Weak opening | Strong opening |
|--------------|----------------|
| "XYZ Corp is a Delaware corporation founded in 1987..." | "XYZ trades at 5x earnings. The market thinks it's dying. It's not." |

**Close with impact.** Asymmetry, action, or one memorable line. No trailing summaries.

---

## Edit in Five Passes

1. **Tighten** — Remove only true redundancy and filler words. Preserve all
   analytical content, evidence, methodology, and reasoning. Clarity over brevity.
2. **Activate** — Passive → active. Nouns → verbs.
3. **Clarify** — Simplify phrasing without losing meaning.
4. **Read aloud** — Stumble = rewrite.
5. **Outsider test** — Unfamiliar reader understands first read?

---

## Voice

**Parentheticals** add personality — 2-4 per 1,000 words.

**Rhetorical questions** engage — max 1-3 per doc.

**Pick one voice, hold it:** Analyst (measured), Advocate (direct), Teacher (explanatory).
